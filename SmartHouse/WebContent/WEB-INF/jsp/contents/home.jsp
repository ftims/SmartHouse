		<p>A smart house is a house that has highly advanced automatic
			systems for lighting, temperature control, multi-media, security,
			window and door operations, and many other functions. A smart home
			appears "intelligent" because its computer systems can monitor so
			many aspects of daily living. For example, the refrigerator may be
			able to inventory its contents, suggest menus, recommend healthy
			alternatives, and order groceries. The smart home systems might even
			take care of cleaning the cat's litter box and watering the plants.

			The idea of a smart home may sound like something out of Hollywood. A
			1999 movie titled Smart House (compare prices) presents the comical
			antics of an American family that wins a "house of the future" with
			an android maid who causes havoc. Other films show a sci-fi vision of
			smart home technology that seems improbable. However, smart home
			technology is real, and it's becoming increasingly sophisticated.
			Coded signals are sent through the home's wiring to switches and
			outlets that are programmed to operate appliances and electronic
			devices in every part of the house. Home automation can be especially
			useful for elderly and disabled persons who wish to live
			independently.</p>
